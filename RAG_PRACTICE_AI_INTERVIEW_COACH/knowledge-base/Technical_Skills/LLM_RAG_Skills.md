# LLM & RAG Skills

## AI Resume RAG & Interview Coach

- Built an **AI Resume RAG & Interview Coach** that indexes personal resume, essays, and technical skills into a Chroma vector store and uses Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce customized resume bullet points and interview responses.

## LangChain RAG Pipeline

- Implemented a **modern LangChain RAG pipeline** using `langchain_core`, `langchain_community`, and `Chroma` as a reusable `retriever | prompt | llm` chain with chat‑history support.

## Environment & Tooling

- Created a dedicated **Python virtual environment (venv)** on Ubuntu for ML/RAG projects, installed and configured `langchain`, `langchain-openai`, `langchain-chroma`, `chromadb`, and `python-dotenv`, and integrated them into a CLI‑based RAG application.

## Summary

These skills demonstrate the ability to:

- Design and implement practical LLM/RAG applications that combine document retrieval with generative models.
- Work with modern LangChain components and vector databases to build reusable pipelines.
- Manage Python environments and dependencies cleanly on Linux servers, and integrate ML workflows into CLI tools that can be automated or extended later.
